## User Stories

1. As a sports bettor, I want to quickly check a player's historical performance against their current matchup so I can make more informed betting decisions.

2. As a DFS player, I want to identify players who consistently over/underperform against specific teams to optimize my lineup selections.

3. As a casual NBA fan, I want simple recommendations on prop bets without having to analyze complex statistics myself.

4. As a data-driven bettor, I want to see the statistical reasoning behind recommendations so I can validate the analysis.
